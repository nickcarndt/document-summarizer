# GitHub Repository Settings Update

The GitHub repository "About" section needs to be updated to reflect the current Next.js/TypeScript stack.

## Current (Incorrect) Settings

**Description:**
```
Summarize and query PDFs with AI (Streamlit + Python + OpenAI API).
```

**Topics:**
- openai
- streamlit
- pdf-summarization
- llm-embeddings

## Updated (Correct) Settings

**Description:**
```
Compare Claude and OpenAI responses side-by-side with a built-in evaluation framework. Upload PDFs, generate summaries, ask questions using RAG, and track metrics.
```

**Topics:**
- nextjs
- typescript
- claude
- openai
- rag
- llm-evaluation
- pdf-summarization
- vercel
- drizzle-orm
- tailwindcss
- anthropic
- llm-comparison

## How to Update

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/nickcarndt/document-summarizer
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) next to "About" in the sidebar
3. Update the description with the new text above
4. Update the topics by removing the old ones and adding the new ones listed above
5. Click "Save changes"

## Why This Matters

The repository description and topics help:
- People discover your project when searching
- Recruiters understand the tech stack at a glance
- The project appears in relevant topic searches
- It accurately represents the current implementation (not the old Python version)
